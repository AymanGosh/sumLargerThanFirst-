Description
Your task is to write a function that receives an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the elements that are bigger than the first element in the array.

For example, given this array: [6, 2, 8, 11, 3, 6]
The result of the function will be 19.

The only numbers that are bigger than the first element (in our case 6) are 8, 11, when we sum them, 8 + 11 we get 19.



The challenge
You are going to write that function in the Go language: https://golang.org/

Don’t worry, we know you don’t know Go. During the bootcamp you will have to learn many new things, so here  is a chance to practice and show us you are up for the task.

Try to be focused and  efficient and not to waste extra time. 


You have a maximum of 1 hour.

Try to  complete the task  as quick as possible (we check the submission time)


Instructions

You can run Go online (no need to install) in this link:  https://play.golang.org/
You can (and should) use google to search for documentation and code examples, and figure out how to code in Go.
To make things easy here is a starter code for the main function:

Write and implement the sumLargerThanFirst function.
Run your code and make sure it works properly.
Make sure your code is clean and ordered (especially indented)
When done submit your entire code (including the main function and imports) as text in the following box.
Make sure to save your code for the upcoming interview.
